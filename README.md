Hello everyone!

If you're seeing this then welcome to my landing page of projects. It has all of my learning projects within.

Folder 'Project 1' - contains 20 Beginner Projects which I orignally copied online but have then modified and/or improved.

Folder 'Project 2' - will contain 20 Intermediate Projects which I orignally copied online but have then modified and/or imrpoved.

Folder 'Project 3' - will contain projects that I created from start to finish without looking at others code

The reason I have done it this way is to give me a foundation of skills and understanding of the Python language. The exposure to more advanced code allows me to break down what it is doing, why it is doing it and how it is doing it. This then allows me to manipulate it later down the line for my own useage.
